# aws-allowlister

![Continuous Integration Tests](https://github.com/salesforce/aws-allowlister/workflows/continuous-integration/badge.svg)

Automatically compile an AWS Service Control Policy that ONLY allows AWS services that are compliant with your preferred compliance frameworks.


## Overview

Service Control Policies (SCPs) are some of the strongest security tools available to configure guardrails and enforce best practices in AWS. One of the biggest challenges with SCPs is writing comprehensive and trustworthy policies that are tailored to your environments. This is especially important when organizations must abide by compliance requirements that have little to no wiggle room when it comes to allowed AWS services or actions. `aws-allowlister` looks to mitigate some of the risks involved with hand-writing policies that align with compliance frameworks by generating compliance-focused "AllowList" SCPs.

The policies generated by `aws-allowlister` are based off of official AWS [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) and are automatically kept up to date when new services achieve compliance or accredidation. `aws-allowlister` currently supports:

* PCI
* SOC 1,2,3
* ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 27017:2015, 27018:2019, and ISO/IEC 9001:2015 and CSA STAR CCM v3.0.1
* HIPAA BAA
* FedRAMP Moderate
* FedRAMP High

In addition to creating compliance-focused SCPs, `aws-allowlister` supports the ability to include or exclude services (IAM permissions) of your choice using the `--include` or `--exclude` flags. For more details related to policy customization, view the [Arguments section](#Arguments).

## Installation

* Python Pip:

```bash
pip3 install aws-allowlister
```

* Homebrew (this will work once we open source it):

```bash
brew tap salesforce/aws-allowlister https://github.com/salesforce/aws-allowlister
brew install aws-allowlister
```

## Usage

* Generate an AllowList Policy using this command:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate
```

By default, it allows policies at the intersection of PCI, HIPAA, SOC, ISO, FedRAMP High, and FedRAMP Moderate.

The resulting policy will look like this:

## Arguments

`aws-allowlister` supports different arguments to generate fine-grained compliance focused Service Control Policy (SCP) AllowLists. You can specify individual flags for the compliance frameworks you care about.

```
Usage: aws-allowlister generate [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -a, --all                SOC, PCI, ISO, HIPAA, FedRAMP_High, and
                           FedRAMP_Moderate.

  -s, --soc                Include SOC-compliant services
  -p, --pci                Include PCI-compliant services
  -h, --hipaa              Include HIPAA-compliant services
  -i, --iso                Include ISO-compliant services
  -fh, --fedramp-high      Include FedRAMP High
  -fm, --fedramp-moderate  Include FedRAMP Moderate
  --include TEXT           Include specific AWS IAM services, specified in a
                           comma separated string.

  --exclude TEXT           Exclude specific AWS IAM services, specified in a
                           comma separated string.

  -q, --quiet
  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```


* For example, to generate a PCI only Service Control Policy and save it to JSON:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --pci --quiet > pci.json
```

* You can also chain command flags together. For example, to generate a Policy for all the major compliance frameworks but FedRAMP:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sphi --quiet
```

* Let's say your organization is not subject to FedRAMP or HIPAA, but you want to create a Policy for SOC, ISO, and PCI:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sip --quiet
```

# Disclaimer
The policies generated by `aws-allowlister` do not guarantee that your AWS accounts will be compliant or that you will become accredited with the supported compliance frameworks. These policies are intended to be a useful tool to assist with restricting which service can or cannot be leveraged.
