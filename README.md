Automatically compile an AWS Service Control Policy that ONLY allows AWS services that are compliant with your preferred compliance frameworks.

## Overview

AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) allow you to control which AWS Service APIs are allowed *at the AWS Account level* - so local administrators (not even the account's root user) can perform prohibited actions in a child account.

 However, before `aws-allowlister`, it was very difficult and error-prone to create AWS AllowList SCPs - only giving accounts access to the compliant services that they need, and nothing else. Before `aws-allowlister`, the approach for creating an AllowList was:
1. Create a spreadsheet üôÑ  based on the [AWS Services in Scope](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) documentation, which have inconsistent naming and do not list the "IAM names"
2. Create an AllowList.json by hand, based on that spreadsheet
3. Roll it out to Dev/Stage/Production
4. Whoever manages that spreadsheet now magically owns the AllowList policy due to ‚ú®tribal knowledge‚ú® and any updates occur by pinging this person over Slack.

`aws-allowlister` takes care of this process for you. Instead of following the painful process above, just run the following command to generate an AWS SCP policy that meets PCI compliance:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --pci
```

The policies generated by `aws-allowlister` are based off of official AWS [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) and are automatically kept up to date when new services achieve compliance or accreditation.


### Support statuses

`aws-allowlister` currently supports:

| Compliance Framework | Support Status |
|----------------------|----------------|
| PCI                  | ‚úÖ             |
| SOC 1, 2, and 3      | ‚úÖ             |
| ISO/IEC              | ‚úÖ             |
| HIPAA BAA            | ‚úÖ             |
| FedRAMP Moderate     | ‚úÖ             |
| FedRAMP High         | ‚úÖ             |
| DOD CC SRG (USA üá∫üá∏)  | ‚úÖ             |
| HITRUST              | ‚úÖ             |
| IRAP (Australia üá¶üá∫)  | ‚úÖ             |
| C5 (Germany üá©üá™)      | ‚è± Coming soon |
| K-ISMS (Japan üáØüáµ)    | ‚è± Coming soon |
| ENS High (Spain üá™üá∏)  | ‚è± Coming soon |

### Forcibly include/exclude services

In addition to creating compliance-focused SCPs, `aws-allowlister` supports the ability to include or exclude services (IAM permissions) of your choice using the `--include` or `--exclude` flags. For more details related to policy customization, view the [Arguments](#arguments) section.

## Installation

* Python Pip:

```bash
pip3 install aws-allowlister
```

* Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap salesforce/aws-allowlister https://github.com/salesforce/aws-allowlister
brew install aws-allowlister
```

## Usage

* Generate an AllowList Policy using this command:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate
```

By default, it allows policies at the intersection of PCI, HIPAA, SOC, ISO, FedRAMP High, and FedRAMP Moderate.

The resulting policy will look like this:

### Markdown Table of Excluded Services

* Let's say you want to know which services are **excluded**, not just the ones that are **included**. In this case, you can specify the `--excluded-table` option to output the list of services that are not allowed.

```
aws-allowlister generate --pci --excluded-table
```

The results will look like this:

## Arguments

`aws-allowlister` supports different arguments to generate fine-grained compliance focused Service Control Policy (SCP) AllowLists. You can specify individual flags for the compliance frameworks you care about.

```
Usage: aws-allowlister generate [OPTIONS]

Options:
  Compliance Standard Selection:
    -a, --all                     SOC, PCI, ISO, HIPAA, FedRAMP_High, and
                                  FedRAMP_Moderate.
    -s, --soc                     Include SOC-compliant services
    -p, --pci                     Include PCI-compliant services
    -h, --hipaa                   Include HIPAA-compliant services
    -i, --iso                     Include ISO-compliant services
    -fh, --fedramp-high           Include FedRAMP High
    -fm, --fedramp-moderate       Include FedRAMP Moderate
    -d2e, --dodccsrg-il2-ew       Include DoD CC SRG IL2 (East/West)
    -d2g, --dodccsrg-il2-gc       Include DoD CC SRG IL2 (GovCloud)
    -d4g, --dodccsrg-il4-gc       Include DoD CC SRG IL4 (GovCloud)
    -d5g, --dodccsrg-il5-gc       Include DoD CC SRG IL5 (GovCloud)
  Forcibly Include AWS Services: [mutually_exclusive]
    --include TEXT                Include specific AWS IAM services, specified
                                  in a comma separated string.
    --include-file PATH           A YAML file that contains a list of AWS IAM
                                  services to include.
  Forcibly Exclude AWS Services: [mutually_exclusive]
    --exclude TEXT                Exclude specific AWS IAM services, specified
                                  in a comma separated string.
    --exclude-file PATH           A YAML file that contains a list of AWS IAM
                                  services to exclude.
  Output options: [mutually_exclusive]
    --table                       Output a markdown-formatted table of the
                                  Service Prefixes alongside Service Names.
    --json-list                   Output a JSON object of the service
                                  prefixes, service names, and authorization
                                  URLs.
    --excluded-table              Output a markdown-formatted table of
                                  *excluded* services.
    --excluded-json-list          Output a JSON object of *excluded* service
                                  prefixes, service names, and authorization
                                  URLs.
  -q, --quiet
  --help                          Show this message and exit.

```


* For example, to generate a PCI only Service Control Policy and save it to JSON:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --pci --quiet > pci.json
```

* You can also chain command flags together. For example, to generate a Policy for all the major compliance frameworks but FedRAMP:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sphi --quiet
```

* Let's say your organization is not subject to FedRAMP or HIPAA, but you want to create a Policy for SOC, ISO, and PCI:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sip --quiet
```

### Exceptions: Including or Excluding Services

If you want to force-exclude or force-include a service, you have two options.
1. Specify the exclusions in command line arguments
2. Specify the exclusions in a YAML file and supply the file name

#### Example: Exclude Services using a file

For example, create a file that is called `exclusions.yml` with the following contents

```yaml
# If you use this for exclusions, this will exclude EC2 and S3. Don't actually do this, this is just for the example
- ec2
- s3
```

Now you can specify the following arguments to leverage this file:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --exclude-file exclusions.yml
```

Alternatively, you can supply the argument inline like this:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate ---exclude ec2,s3
```

Notice how the output does not include `ec2` or `s3` in the output.

        }
}
```

#### Example: Including a service using a file

You can also use this approach for force-including services. Let's say that you want to include the AWS Managed BlockChain Services because your CEO is convinced you're going to the moon üöÄ (even though the AWS Managed BlockChain service does not meet any common compliance frameworks like PCI or HIPAA). You could create a file called `include.yml` with the contents:

```yaml
- managedblockchain
```

Then run the following command:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --include-file include.yml
```

Alternatively, you can supply the argument inline like this:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --include managedblockchain
```

Notice how the output includes the `managedblockchain` service.
