![Continuous Integration Tests](https://github.com/salesforce/aws-allowlister/workflows/continuous-integration/badge.svg)

Automatically compile an AWS Service Control Policy that ONLY allows AWS services that are compliant with your preferred compliance frameworks.


## Overview

AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) allow you to control which AWS Service APIs are allowed *at the AWS Account level* - so local administrators (not even the account's root user) can perform prohibited actions in a child account.

 However, before `aws-allowlister`, it was very difficult and error-prone to create AWS AllowList SCPs - only giving accounts access to the compliant services that they need, and nothing else. Before `aws-allowlister`, the approach for creating an AllowList was:
1. Create a spreadsheet ðŸ™„  based on the [AWS Services in Scope](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) documentation, which have inconsistent naming and do not list the "IAM names"
2. Create an AllowList.json by hand, based on that spreadsheet
3. Roll it out to Dev/Stage/Production
4. Whoever manages that spreadsheet now magically owns the AllowList policy due to âœ¨tribal knowledgeâœ¨ and any updates occur by pinging this person over Slack.

`aws-allowlister` takes care of this process for you. Instead of following the painful process above, just run the following command to generate an AWS SCP policy that meets PCI compliance:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --pci
```

The policies generated by `aws-allowlister` are based off of official AWS [documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/) and are automatically kept up to date when new services achieve compliance or accreditation. `aws-allowlister` currently supports:

* PCI
* SOC 1,2,3
* ISO/IEC
* HIPAA BAA
* FedRAMP Moderate
* FedRAMP High

In addition to creating compliance-focused SCPs, `aws-allowlister` supports the ability to include or exclude services (IAM permissions) of your choice using the `--include` or `--exclude` flags. For more details related to policy customization, view the [Arguments](#arguments) section.

## Installation

* Python Pip:

```bash
pip3 install aws-allowlister
```

* Homebrew (this will work once we open source it):

```bash
brew tap salesforce/aws-allowlister https://github.com/salesforce/aws-allowlister
brew install aws-allowlister
```

## Usage

* Generate an AllowList Policy using this command:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate
```

By default, it allows policies at the intersection of PCI, HIPAA, SOC, ISO, FedRAMP High, and FedRAMP Moderate.

The resulting policy will look like this:

## Arguments

`aws-allowlister` supports different arguments to generate fine-grained compliance focused Service Control Policy (SCP) AllowLists. You can specify individual flags for the compliance frameworks you care about.

```
Usage: aws-allowlister generate [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -a, --all                SOC, PCI, ISO, HIPAA, FedRAMP_High, and
                           FedRAMP_Moderate.

  -s, --soc                Include SOC-compliant services
  -p, --pci                Include PCI-compliant services
  -h, --hipaa              Include HIPAA-compliant services
  -i, --iso                Include ISO-compliant services
  -fh, --fedramp-high      Include FedRAMP High
  -fm, --fedramp-moderate  Include FedRAMP Moderate
  --include TEXT           Include specific AWS IAM services, specified in a
                           comma separated string.

  --exclude TEXT           Exclude specific AWS IAM services, specified in a
                           comma separated string.

  -q, --quiet
  --help                   Show this message and exit.
```


* For example, to generate a PCI only Service Control Policy and save it to JSON:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate --pci --quiet > pci.json
```

* You can also chain command flags together. For example, to generate a Policy for all the major compliance frameworks but FedRAMP:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sphi --quiet
```

* Let's say your organization is not subject to FedRAMP or HIPAA, but you want to create a Policy for SOC, ISO, and PCI:

```bash
aws-allowlister generate -sip --quiet
```

# Disclaimer
The policies generated by `aws-allowlister` do not guarantee that your AWS accounts will be compliant or that you will become accredited with the supported compliance frameworks. These policies are intended to be a useful tool to assist with restricting which service can or cannot be leveraged.
